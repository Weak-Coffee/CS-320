# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best to ensure that code is functional and secure is by understanding the concept of secure coding and adhereing to industry standards and best practices. Following the OWASP secure coding practices quick reference guide is one way of doing this. Another way is by thrououghly testing your product. We spent a lot of time in this course working on dependency management and identifying vulnerabilites. Identifying risk and weakness in your code base is a good way of ensuring that your final product is secure and functional. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by trying to understand what the program intends to do, what problem is it trying to solve or service is it trying to offer. I then refence the program design documents, look at all the components and see how they work together. 

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with an open mind. There is a million different ways you design software. I do research to see how/if others have solved created something similar and determine what approach they took to complete the task.
